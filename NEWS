Changes in RODBCext 0.2.1 (2014-07-04)

  * Some minor changes to eliminate notices raised on a package check:
    * too long line in sqlExecute() examples splitted
    * @import annotations added 

Changes in RODBCext 0.2 (2014-07-01)

  * Changes in API - ability to prepare and execute query in one call moved 
    from sqlPrepare() to sqlExecute():
    * sqlPrepare() now takes only channel, query and errors arguments
    * sqlExecute() now takes additional query=NA argument

  * Added support for drivers which don't provide SQLDescribeParam() ODBC call
    (by applying data types from data passed to sqlExecute())

  * sqlExecute() now merges results of all queries if nrows(data) > 1 and 
    fetch=TRUE

  * Added functions sqlFetchMore() and odbcFetchRows() which avoid calls to 
    RODBC::sqlFetchMore() and RODBC::odbcFetchRows() when connection handle is 
    in a "query prepared but not executed" state (which caused R to crash)

  * Switch from RODBC::sqlFetchMore() to RODBC::sqlGetResults() for fetching 
    results (now we don't care about queries which do not produce any results
    like UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, etc. queries)

Changes in RODBCext 0.1 (2014-05-28)

  * First version of the package.
